Introduction Statement Streamixy is a Web3-powered music AI platform that revolutionizes music ranking by tapping into the voice of the crowd. It scans major social platforms, streaming data, and radio mentions in real time, then publishes a transparent, on-chain global chart. Think of it as the Billboard for the decentralized era driven by data, not deals.

Problem Statement Todayâ€™s music charts are often shaped by opaque industry negotiations, selective reporting, and delayed data cycles. Artists without label backing struggle for fair recognition, while fans rarely see how rankings are determined. This lack of transparency erodes trust, limits artist exposure, and fails to reflect true, real-time cultural impact.

Solution Statement Streamixy delivers a trustless, data-driven alternative. Our AI aggregates live music engagement from across social platforms, streaming services, and radio, then anchors the results on-chain for full transparency and immutability. This creates a real-time, global music chart where every rank is verifiable, community-powered, and resistant to manipulation empowering both independent artists and fans to shape music history together.
